**Problem** : Write a function that takes in a sentence as a string and replaces specific words "smile", "smiling", "cry", "cries", "angry", "anger", "annoying", "annoyed" with their corresponding emoticons "ðŸ™‚", "ðŸ˜­", "ðŸ˜¡", "ðŸ˜’" respectively, using javaScript.

|word  |  emoticon|
|-------|-----------|
|smile |    ðŸ™‚|
|cry    |   ðŸ˜­|
|angry  |   ðŸ˜¡|
|annoying|  ðŸ˜’|

```Test Cases```

```python
Test Cases :
Input :
sentence1 = "I want to smile";
sentence2 = "I want to cry";
sentence3 = "Why is he angry ?";
sentence4 = "he is so annoying";
sentence5 = "I was so annoyed when my computer crashed, but now I'm just smiling because I fixed it and it's not a big deal anymore, even though it was cry worthy at first.";

output :
I want to ðŸ™‚
I want to ðŸ˜­
Why is he ðŸ˜¡ ?
he is so ðŸ˜’
I was so ðŸ˜’ when my computer crashed, but now I'm just ðŸ™‚ because I fixed it and it's not a big deal anymore, even though it was ðŸ˜­ worthy at first.
```
