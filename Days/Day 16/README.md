**Problem** :  Create a function that takes a string of words and returns the highest scoring word. Each letter of a word scores points according to it's position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, etc.

Note :
- If two words score the same, return the word that appears first in the original string.
- The returned string should only contain alphabetic characters (a-z).
- Preserve case in the returned string

```Test Cases```

```python
Input : 
str1 = "Wednesday is an amazing series";
Output :  series
_________________________________

Input : 
str2 = "AI is not science fiction, it is the future";
Output : future
```
